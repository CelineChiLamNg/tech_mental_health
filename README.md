1. For section 3, preparing the answers for the questions, I could create one 
   only dataset with 12 columns, instead of 12 datasets.  



TODO:
pick important questions - questions present in all 5 surveys so we can 
compare.
3. rn cleaning up odd replies from users \ 
need to calculate available_data for all 12 questions and visualize in 
   barplots\
need to treat outliers 
visualize the distribution of the answers for each question 


modules for functions:
to_boolean_none 
yes_no_to_boolean

user_questions = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 20, 21, 22]
mental_health_questions = [6, 7]
company_questions = [8, 9]
company_mental_health_questions = [10, 11, 15, 16, 23]
opinion_questions = [12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 24]
