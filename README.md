# Project Summary
This project aims to analyze the mental health situation and evolution in the 
Tech industry in specific, through analyzing answers from a survey from years 
2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.

Due to the large amount and variety of questions in the surveys, it was 
important to select key questions and conduct analysis based on them. The 
survey also included a large sampling population which was not consistent, 
so understanding our population was important to avoid bias. The analysis not
only displayed answers normalized to the amount of participants per survey, 
but hypothesis testing was also applied to ensure statistical significance 
in our results. 

In the end of the analysis, some recommendations were made for the Tech 
industry to continue to improve its communities' mental health situation.

## Data source
mental health data: 'mental_health.sqlite'
US map data: 'cb_2018_us_state_500k'

# Improvements
1. For section 3, preparing the answers for the questions, I could create one 
   only dataset with 12 columns, instead of 12 datasets.
2. Could try to calculate post-hoc for chi-square tests.
3. Normalize number of users to the population of each country, state.
4. Create perform chi-square tests to check significance in difference in 
   section 3.4. 
5. Dive deeper to other questions from the survey.
6. Have all functions organized in a separate file.
