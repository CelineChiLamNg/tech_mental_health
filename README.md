## Methods used

# Conclusion/Results

# Recommendations

# Improvements
1. For section 3, preparing the answers for the questions, I could create one 
   only dataset with 12 columns, instead of 12 datasets.
2. Could try to calculate post-hoc for chi-square
3. Normalize number of users to the population of each country, state.



TODO:
4. compare tech industry and gender on questioins 10-12
how to compare:
I want to understand what the users stance/opinion and how are the 
   companies dealing to mental health issues (officially and actually)
-seems that trust, communication between 2 parties and social awareness are 
lacking
- there is visual correlation between people with families with mental 
  health and number of users seeking therapists. Between less tech 
  companies and more people are seeking for therapists. Between more 
  females and more people seeking for therapists. But how are people feeling?
also, more companies are providing mental health coverage. Anonymity barely 
  improved (unclear correlation). Users choose not to bring up mental health
  (hasn't changed over years)
- 
-seems that tech industry has worse mental health than other industries
- seems that female are having a better with this mental health situation
